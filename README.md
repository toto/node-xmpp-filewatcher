xmpp-filewatch watches a directoy tree for changes and notifies subscribers
about those changes using jabber.

This is my first node.js project and my JavaScript is quite rusty, so be gentle to my software.

Requirements 
============

Depends on the following node modules to be installed
 
 - node-xmpp
 - watch
 - json
 
The quickest way to install them (provided you have set up npm) is:
 
`npm install node-xmpp watch json`
